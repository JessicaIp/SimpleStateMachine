/*
*  This is a generic state machine that can be used to track state and transitions between them.
*  At all times, transitions will be determined based on the currently stored state and updated
*  using the transition method.
*
*  NOTE: You cannot set the currentState manually, the purpose is for the SM to track this automatically.
*        All transitions are handled by the SM to ensure correctness of the system.
*
*
*  This supports subscripting for assigning transitions, for example:
*
*  SimpleStateMachine[State1] =
*     [ Event1 : State2,
*       Event2 : State3 ]
*
*
*  Fictitious example:
*
*  SimpleStateMachine[introState] =
*      [ loginAction : termsAndConditionsVC,
*        facebookLoginAction : onboardingVC,
*        skipAction : dismissLogic ]
*
